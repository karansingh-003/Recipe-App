# Recipe-App
🔧 Working of the Recipe App
UI Setup with HTML & CSS

Create a simple layout with:

A search input field

A search button

A container to display recipe results (image, title, ingredients, instructions)

API Integration with JavaScript

Use fetch() or async/await to call a public recipe API (e.g., https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=pasta)

Trigger the API call when the user enters a dish name and clicks the search button

Parsing and Displaying Data

On a successful API response:

Extract key details: image, name, ingredients, instructions

Dynamically generate and insert HTML into the page to show this data

Error Handling

If no dish is found, show a friendly message like “Recipe not found.”

Handle network errors gracefully
